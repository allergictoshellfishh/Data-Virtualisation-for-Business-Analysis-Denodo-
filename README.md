# Data Virtualisation  For Business Analysis Denodo-
DVRT Assignment where I used a bike database data to create unified view for stock analysis.

## Problem Statement
The bike retail company maintains its operational data across multiple datasets, including orders, order items, products, stocks, staffs and more. Although each dataset is individually useful, the lack of integration results in fragmented information that limits insights about the company’s overall business performance. 

These inefficiencies can negatively affect customer satisfaction, as customers may not be able to purchase the products they want at their preferred store. Over time, this can lead to lost sales opportunities and reduced customer retention.

**This assignment aims to help store managers and operations teams gain a unified, store-level, and near real-time view of customer demand and inventory distribution across retail outlets to ensure customer needs, improving customer satisfaction.** By integrating sales, inventory, and product category data using a data virtualization approach, the solution supports better inventory planning, improves product availability across stores, and ultimately enhances customer satisfaction and retention.
